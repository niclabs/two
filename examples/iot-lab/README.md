# HTTP/2 server on IoT-Lab targets

The [IoT-Lab](https://www.iot-lab.info) is an open large scale testbed for testing applications in wireless sensor networks. It allows testing with multiple types of boards, architectures and communication technologies. For more information on how to use the testbed, please see the [IoT-Lab tutorials](https://www.iot-lab.info/tutorials/).

This example allows to build and run a HTTP/2 server in an IoT-Lab m3 board.
